        <h3 class="text-center">Chicken</h3>
        <p>
            The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. As one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion in 2011, there are more chickens in the world than any other species of bird or domestic animal. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs.Whether you’re talking Arroz con Pollo, Hainanese Chicken Rice, or Oyako Donburi; chicken and rice is a classic pairing that has permeated culinary culture around the world. It makes sense that earlier in human history, this staple seed would be combined with a domesticated source of protein, but the fact that this combination has endured as a popular favorite today, speaks to its unassailable deliciousness.

            Although widely associated with Indian cuisine, Chicken Biryani is a dish that has spread across a wide swath of South Asia, reaching as far west as Iraq, and as far east as Indonesia. The vast geographical area Biryani calls home has resulted in a huge variety of preparations and ingredients.

            Pulao (a.k.a. Pilaf), a similar rice dish can be found in the same areas. While there’s some debate as to the difference between Biryani and Pulao, the latter tends to have less meat and veggies relative to the rice, which means it’s usually served as a side rather than an entree. The second big difference is that Biryani is usually layered and steamed, which creates a wonderful variation in flavor, texture and color when it’s all mixed together at the end.

            The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the juices of the chicken as it cooks, giving it a tend
            er texture and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy. Burie
            d in the Biryani, you’ll find whole cuts of succulent chicken that are bursting with flavor from the potent array of spices, herbs and aromatics it’s marinated in.
            For my version, I’ve simplified the preparation a bit by marinating the chicken in a spicy mixture of garam masala, garlic,
            ginger, chili peppers, cilantro and garlic. When fried, the spices and aromatics on the exterior of the chicken caramelize 
            into an insanely flavorful crust. I like to cook the onions separately, as it allows you to fully
            caramelize them into an sweet umami-packed layer that contrasts the spicy savory chicken. For the rice, a quick par-boil with cardamom,
            bay leaves and cumin infuses some flavor, while ensuring the rice is tender enough steam after the Biryani is assembled.        </p>

            "Chicken" originally referred to young domestic fowl. The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens", sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands). The word "chicken" is sometimes erroneously construed to mean females exclusively, despite the term "hen" for females being in wide circulation.

            In the Deep South of the United States chickens are also referred to by the slang term yardbird.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some breeds the adult rooster can be distinguished from the hen by his larger comb
            Chickens are omnivores. In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even larger animals such as lizards, small snakes or young mice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chickens may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed. The world's oldest chicken, a hen, died of heart failure at the age of 16 according to Guinness World Records.
